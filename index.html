            <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination
                of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
                quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and
                served hot.</p>

            <p>noodle, a cooked egg-and-flour paste prominent in European and Asian cuisine, generally distinguished
                from pasta by its elongated ribbonlike form. Noodles are commonly used to add body and flavour to broth
                soups. They are commonly boiled or sautéed and served with sauces and meats or baked in casseroles.</p>

            <p>Although it is believed to have its origins in Persia, zulbia or jalebi is an international dessert with
                variations that spread throughout the Middle East, India, and Asia. In its basic form, this sweet
                dessert is created by combining flour with yogurt or ghee, as well as baking soda or yeast to create a
                batter which is then poured in circular patterns directly into the sizzling oil.</p>
